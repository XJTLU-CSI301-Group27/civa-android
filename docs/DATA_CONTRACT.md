# Data Contract

Status: Draft

This document is the source of truth for cross-group data. The team must agree on
the final storage representation before implementation. Public contracts must
not be changed silently.

Every contract must define:

- business meaning;
- field names, types, and nullability;
- identifier and relationships;
- ownership: personal or household;
- quantity, unit, date, and time rules;
- empty and error semantics;
- provider and allowed callers;
- related tests.

## Contract status

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Draft | Under discussion; callers must not depend on it |
| Agreed | Approved for implementation |
| Implemented | Provider implementation exists |
| Tested | Contract and integration tests pass |
